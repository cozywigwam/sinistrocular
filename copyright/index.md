All photographs and images (including the logo) are copyright 2016 [all rights reserved]({{ site.github_url }}/LICENSE-photography.md). Since the overall desire is to promote understanding and conservancy, I would like something permissive to non-profit ecological conservancy groups, research endeavors, and students; yet not to unnamed profiteers. So... this will likely change, but I don't know when.

The Jekyll code is [MIT]({{ site.github_url }}/LICENSE-jekyll.md). My code is [GPL]({{ site.github_url }}/LICENSE-sinistrocular-code.md).
