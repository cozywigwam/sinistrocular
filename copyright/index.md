### Photography

Look for copyright information in each photograph file's metadata. If the file's metadata lacks copyright information, then it is copyright 2016 Grant Surratt, all rights reserved. I am moving toward CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, so I will likely publish photographs under that license moving forward (and possibly change the copyright of previously published photographs).

### Images & SVG

All images that contain the Sinistrocular logo are copyright 2016 Grant Surratt, all rights reserved. All non-logo-related images are considered part of the code.

### Code

The Jekyll code is [MIT]({{ site.github_url }}/LICENSE-jekyll.md). My code, with the exception of logo-related images, is [GPL]({{ site.github_url }}/LICENSE-sinistrocular-code.md).
