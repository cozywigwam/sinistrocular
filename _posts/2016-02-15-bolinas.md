"It's always a special day when I see a woodpecker," I heard once. That's how I feel about avocets. A few sought fish along the eastern edge of Bolinas Lagoon, not far from a couple rafts of ducks.

Birds were everywhere.

And what a delight, a Townsend's warbler. He hopped along on the ground searching for food.

And finding food.
