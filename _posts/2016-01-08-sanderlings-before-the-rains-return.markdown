intro: When days-long rain eases in the afternoon, the cameras and lenses yearn for the sunset. This time around, though, it wasn't a full reprieve. New rains approached the shore quickly behind the edge of the previous volley, so the sunset itself only spoke to us as a person attempts to speak above a fence.

I started running with the waves, too, after a cold one said a surprise hello to my shoes and legs. Ocean Beach can come in tens of feet in just a few seconds.
