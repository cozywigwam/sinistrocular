intro: It's always a special day when I see a woodpecker, I heard once. That's how I feel about avocets. A few sought food toward the eastern edge of Bolinas Lagoon, not far from two small rafts of ducks.

The lagoon teemed with avian life, including green-winged teals and a great blue heron.

Vultures inhabited the wooded trail that lead to the western edge of the lagoon. A Say's phoebe and a yellow-rumped warbler (not pictured) bounced between lookout spots in the open scrub. Inside the woods, the usual suspects went about their day.

And what a delight, a Townsend's warbler. He hopped along the ground, snacking on tasty bugs.
