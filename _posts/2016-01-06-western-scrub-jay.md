Wikipedia's [Western scrub jay entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_scrub_jay) lacks the hypen: Western scrub jay. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology's All About Birds [entry](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Western_Scrub-Jay/id), however, features an n-dash, and has all three leading words capitalized: Western Scrub-Jay.
