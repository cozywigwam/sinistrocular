title: Birds

Every morning I would wake and think, "Lo, what birds doth yonder sing?" Could I see them from my bedroom window? Nay, the view was blocked.

Over time, the familiarity of their cadences and rhythms blessed my mornings as I made coffee and contemplated the day's activities, but I still didn't know them past the "bird with the triplets" or "that one with the repeated lead-in note."
 
 One day, particularly besotted with curiosity, I installed an application on my phone that could present local birds with vocalization samples. Not knowing a pelican from a picid, I decided it made the most sense to start at the top and click through them all. As you probably expect, my original discoveries were extremely rare and exotic species, including the mysterious American robin, the reclusive song sparrow, and the rarely encountered northern cardinal.
 
My bird photography is partly my journey into the world of avian knowledge and partly my hope to share their peace, power, and marvels. Please feel free to view more of my work on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/semitone/) and/or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cozywigwam).
