I'm a photographer living in San Francisco. I grew up in Georgia, then spent a few years in Brooklyn before heading west. A friend of mine, [Melissa Schollaert](http://msp-photography.com/), graciously gave me some lessons and helped fuel my interest when I got started in Atlanta. My prevailing subject interest is birds, but I also enjoy photographing land, sky, cities, and people.

I tweet like a loon on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cozywigwam) and I post semi-regularly on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/semitone/). I am trying to get going with [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sinistrocular/), seeing what 1:1 feels like. To say hello, notify me of an error, or discuss opportunities, please email me at grant at sinistrocular dot com. Thank you for visiting my website!
