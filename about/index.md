Hi, my name is Grant Surratt. Welcome to my photography website.

I have eleven years' worth of posts on [Flickr]. More recently, I've been having fun foisting cute dog pictures on my friends on [Instagram] (plus some vidoes and timelapse efforts), and I occasionally "tweet" on [Twitter]. I love this Twitter feed because it's basically all birds.
