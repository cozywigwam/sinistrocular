I'm a photographer living in San Francisco, CA. I grew up in Georgia, then spent a few years in Brooklyn before heading west. A friend of mine, [Melissa Schollaert](http://msp-photography.com/), graciously gave me some free lessons and helped fuel my interest when I got started in Atlanta. My prevailing interest is birds these days, but I also enjoy photographing landscapes, cityscapes, and people.

I tweet like a loon on Twitter and I post semi-regularly on Flickr. To say hello, notify me of an error, or discuss opportunities, please email me at grant@sinistrocular.com.

Oh, and "sinistrocular" means left-eye dominant. Words are fun!
