Hi, my name is Grant Surratt. I'm a photographer living in San Francisco. I grew up in Georgia, then spent a few years in Brooklyn before heading west. A friend of mine, [Melissa Schollaert](http://msp-photography.com/), graciously gave me some lessons and helped fuel my interest when I got started in Atlanta. My prevailing subject interest is birds, but I also enjoy photographing land, sky, cities, and people.

I tweet about birds on [Twitter] and I post photographs similar to the ones found on this website on [Flickr]. The 1:1 aspect ratio isn't the most natural form for me, but I've been giving it a go on [Instagram]. To say hello, notify me of an error, or discuss opportunities, please email me at grant at sinistrocular dot com. Thank you for visiting my website!
