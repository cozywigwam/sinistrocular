Hi, my name is Grant Surratt. I'm a photographer living in San Francisco. I grew up in Georgia, then spent a few years in Brooklyn before heading west. A friend of mine, [Melissa Schollaert](http://msp-photography.com/), graciously gave me some lessons and helped fuel my interest when I got started in Atlanta. My prevailing subject interest is birds, but I also enjoy photographing land, sky, cities, and people.

I have eleven years' worth of posts on [Flickr]. More recently, I've been having fun foisting cute dog pictures on my friends on [Instagram] (plus some vidoes and timelapse efforts), and I occasionally "tweet" on [Twitter]. I love this Twitter feed because it's basically all birds.
