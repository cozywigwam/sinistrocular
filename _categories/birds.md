Our fine feathered friends never cease to amaze me. Noticing that birds don't sing enough and they often fail to wear nametags, I started photographing birds as an aid for identification. Learning about birds is an unending quest, and my enjoyment of studying them is topped only by being among them. I consider the avian presence a special joy for our brief lifespans on this planet, and a treasure that our future generations deserve.
